# Media Theory - Media and Its Nature

**This page is translated by ChatGPT.**

This chapter will explore a particular type of intelligent agent.
In the previous chapter, in the section on multi-objective learning, we mentioned that the relationship between humans and knives is unequal in symbiosis because humans possess multi-objective intelligence, making them less susceptible to the influence of a single objective.
In this chapter, we will delve deeper into this unique symbiotic relationship.
To begin, let's first define some terms:

**Definition**

```text
Media: An individual agent that forms an n:1 symbiotic relationship with multiple objects is referred to as a medium.
```

Note that the definition of medium in this text is different from that described by McLuhan in communication studies. The medium in communication studies belongs to a subset of the mediums discussed in this text.

Typical examples of mediums discussed in this text include:

| Medium | Symbiotic Objects |
| --- | --- |
| Humans | All tools |
| Money | Humans |
| Government/Companies/Social Organizations | Humans |
| Communication Mediums | Humans |
| Academic Systems | Researchers |
| Nvidia | Deep learning models |
| Genes | Species corresponding to the genes |


## Properties

* Stability: The emergence of a medium is mutually nurtured under the influence of multiple objectives, hence the existence of a medium needs to meet the expectations of these multiple objectives. Even if one objective encounters unforeseen risks, the medium is unlikely to lose its remaining symbiotic value. The remaining symbiotic objectives can still ensure the survival rate of the medium.

* Typically Aimed at Proliferation: Mediums usually aim at proliferation, always tending towards developing more symbiotic objects. This is because the significance of a medium's birth lies in its symbiotic value, and the more it can symbiotically coexist with, the more stable its existence becomes. Astute readers may notice that for mediums, the aim of proliferation is very close to the ultimate goal of survival, but there is still a gap. However, because proliferation is the most easily measurable and achievable goal, the development of mediums always tends towards proliferation.

* Strengthened with Proliferation: Since symbiosis is a mutually beneficial relationship, when more objects start utilizing a medium, the medium itself becomes more suitable for survival, which is also the source of the medium's stability. At the same time, being more suitable for survival generally means that the medium's overall capabilities will be enhanced, including stronger functionality, greater power, more authority, and stronger dissemination power.

* Further Proliferation with Strengthening: When a medium possesses stronger survival capabilities, it also possesses stronger functionality and dissemination power. Therefore, other individuals are more inclined to symbiotically coexist with the medium, leveraging its increased power to achieve their own goals.

* Conforms to Population Growth Models: In this relationship where strength leads to proliferation and proliferation leads to strength, the proliferation rate is directly proportional to the scale of symbiotic coexistence of the medium, forming a relationship similar to $y=\alpha y'$. Therefore, medium growth will follow an exponential population growth curve until the environmental carrying capacity reaches its limit, that is, when no more individuals can symbiotically coexist with the medium.
