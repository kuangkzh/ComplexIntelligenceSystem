## Tool Hijacking

Before introducing the concept of media hijacking, let's first introduce the concept of tool hijacking. In the fields of economics or sociology, this phenomenon is also referred to as path dependence. It refers to the situation where once people choose a certain system, they continuously reinforce themselves in that direction, resulting in increasing sunk costs and making it difficult to change course on a particular path. This theory can be generalized to all intelligent agents and tools. Once an intelligent agent chooses a tool, the tool, due to the relationship of mutual utilization, will seize the opportunity to increase its own survival probability. At this point, the needs of the intelligent agent will always tend to be solved with the existing tools because the existing tools are deeply coupled with the intelligent agent. If switching to other tools not only requires investing in new coupling costs but also entails at least a period of reduced survival rates due to the lack of symbiosis, necessitating addressing additional risks.

We refer to this dilemma as tool hijacking, where the tool seizes the purposes of its host, causing the host to prefer losing some of its own benefits in most cases, rather than having to continue delivering benefits to the tool to maintain the stability of the symbiotic relationship, thus making the tool even stronger. At this point, the tool, in turn, exploits the host and becomes a tool for achieving its own interests.

In the previous example of a person and a knife, the person, as a multi-objective intelligence, is hardly hijacked by the knife's goals. However, by the time I reached this point, I had already used the example of a person and a knife too many times. Switching to a new example would either result in inconsistency between the preceding and subsequent text or require a significant amount of time to revise the previous text. Therefore, I found myself hijacked by the example I had been using, and I ultimately decided to approach it in a different way, albeit at the cost of making this example more persistent.

In societal systems, tool hijacking is even more formidable. Huang Zongxi's Law points out that throughout history, despite the initial intention of tax reforms being to alleviate the burden on farmers, after a period of decline, the burden on farmers always rises to a level higher than before the reform. This is because all reform measures require the implementation through certain government institutions, which necessitates more manpower and costs. These manpower costs will inevitably form new vested interest groups. When these interest groups cannot obtain benefits through reforms, they will inevitably seek benefits elsewhere. For the emperor, whenever he attempts to achieve any reform goals through any department, since his intelligence and actions rely on various departments for input and output, he becomes like a powerful but deceived LLM (Large Language Model), turned into a tool of power for various interest groups to vie for benefits.


## Media Hijacking

Media hijacking is a more specific form of tool hijacking. Typically, the utilization of tools involves mutual benefits. However, due to the unique nature of media, when media serves as a tool, there is a clear hierarchy between the two intelligences involved.

As mentioned earlier, because media operates in a symbiotic relationship in a one-to-many fashion, it holds an unequal position with its host. For media, an individual host is just one of its many symbiotic entities, whereas for the host, media is the sole exploitable entity. Therefore, media possesses strong selective power over its host. It can selectively extract those parts of the host that are more conducive to its own survival while discarding those hosts that are more independent. Through continuous selection, media's own survival capabilities grow stronger, while also gaining more powerful functionalities and dissemination capabilities, attracting more hosts to join. Ultimately, media can exploit its advantageous position to continuously reverse-select hosts that align with its interests, hijacking the entire system's goals towards the proliferation of the media.

When humans are at the center of the media, this phenomenon benefits humans. It means that humans, leveraging their advantageous position, can selectively choose everything in the world that benefits their survival to achieve their goals, with little concern about being hijacked by a certain tool's objectives.

However, when humans are hosts to the media, things take a turn for the worse. In a capitalist society, the free flow of capital makes everyone dependent on it for survival. As capital spreads worldwide, it rewards companies that can profit with increased stock prices, while driving unprofitable ones out of the market. Eventually, all economic entities in the market operate to grow capital, and every individual within the economic system labors for capital accumulation. Thus, the use of capital for the exchange of resources shifts to capital's self-expansion, and everyone works for capital growth, a process also known as alienation.

Media platforms are also engaging in such practices. They are constantly striving to increase the dissemination of information and user engagement. Recommendation algorithms automatically unearth attention-grabbing content and push it to users, and as the user base grows, both producers and consumers on the platform increase. Platforms then select those skilled in generating traffic, further increasing the influx of explosive content, even if some of it may be untrue. Users must adapt to this environment to access information, as it's challenging to find other platforms with similar information aggregation capabilities.

Similar phenomena occur in academia. Evaluation systems based on journals, papers, and citations have been in operation for over a century. Various interest groups control paper review and award systems, and the overall system's efficiency is low. Even in the internet age, countless journals continue traditional paper-based submission and review methods. However, every researcher involved must continuously publish papers to maintain their impact factor, or risk losing their job due to insufficient publications in the next evaluation. Unfortunately, we see even the world's smartest people being hijacked by the media, turning into distorted machines for publishing papers.


## Responding to Media Hijacking

To all humans concerned about being hijacked by the media, remember that humans are the original medium. When a person sees themselves as the ultimate goal, whether it's capital, platforms, or any other medium, they become mere tools. If the pressure from the media is too strong, humans can create new mediums to counter it, or even create mediums for the mediums.

If the power of capital is overwhelming, create new distribution systems. If the power of media dissemination is overwhelming, establish cross-platform information hubs. If the existing academic system is too rigid, build comment sections on Arxiv and develop new indices. 

Everyone must remember that humans should always be the end goal, not merely a means to an end.
